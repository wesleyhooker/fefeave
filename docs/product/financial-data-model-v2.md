# FefeAve Financial Data Model (V2)

Status: Draft
Last Updated: 2026-05-28

## Purpose

This document defines **what information FefeAve should collect** so that future
analytics, profit planning, taxes, reinvestment tracking, and owner-draw features
can be built **without major schema redesigns**.

It is the data-layer companion to
[`financials-vision-v2.md`](./financials-vision-v2.md). Where the vision document
answers _"where is the product going?"_, this document answers:

> **"What data should exist to support that vision?"**

This is a **design document only**. It does not change production code, add
tables, migrations, API endpoints, UI fields, analytics, or reports. It is a
reference to consult whenever a new field, entity, or workflow is proposed.

### How to read this document

Every proposed field is tagged so the reader can tell what is real today versus
what is aspirational:

- **[Existing]** — already in the database today (verified against
  `backend/migrations/`).
- **[Recommended]** — should be added in the foreseeable future; high value,
  clearly tied to a vision question.
- **[Optional]** — plausibly useful, but only worth adding when a concrete need
  appears.

For every non-trivial field we state **why it exists** and **which future
business question it helps answer**, per the vision document's data-collection
philosophy ("Storage is cheap. Missing historical data is expensive.").

## Current Model at a Glance

The schema today centers on **shows → settlements → payments → balances**, plus
generalized **accounts**, **owner self-pay**, and a minimal **inventory** ledger.

| Concept (this doc)            | Backing table(s) today                                    | Notes                                                            |

| Settlement                    | `owed_line_items` (+ `settlement_lines`)                  | One obligation per wholesaler per show; itemized detail optional |
| Payment                       | `payments` (+ `payment_allocations`)                      | Allocated against line items                                     |
| Wholesaler Account            | `accounts` (type `WHOLESALER`), legacy `wholesalers`      | Unified accounts model                                           |
| Owner Account                 | `accounts` (type `OWNER`), `owner_self_pay_transactions`  | Single owner account (Felicia)                                   |
| Inventory Purchase            | `inventory_purchases`                                     | Cash-based, no SKU                                               |
| Adjustments / Fees            | `adjustments` (`PLATFORM_FEE`, `REFUND`, …)               | Fees captured as adjustments, not first-class                    |
| Business Expense              | `owed_line_items` w/ `obligation_kind=VENDOR_EXPENSE`     | Vendor-only; not general overhead                                |
| Owner Draw (future)           | `owner_self_pay_transactions.transaction_type=OWNER_DRAW` | Type exists; not yet a planning surface                          |
| Tax Reserve (future)          | _none_                                                    | Gap                                                              |

> **Convention:** "Settlement" in product language maps to the
> `owed_line_items` row whose `obligation_kind = 'SHOW_LINKED'`. The same table
> also stores manual vendor expenses (`obligation_kind = 'VENDOR_EXPENSE'`).

## 1. Show

### Purpose

Represents a live selling event (Whatnot, Instagram, or manual). The unit around
which revenue, payouts, and per-event profitability are measured. Shows are the
primary lens for the vision document's **Show Performance** questions.

> **Implementation note (2026-05-28, branch `feat/inventory-enrichment-foundation`):**
> The near-term profitability-capture fields **`shows.started_at`**,
> **`shows.ended_at`** (timestamptz), and **`show_financials.platform_fee_amount`**
> (numeric) are now implemented as nullable, backward-compatible columns. They are
> captured optionally on the Log Show form; no profit-per-hour or platform
> comparison analytics were built — capture only, per the "collect data before
> building analytics" guideline.

| `viewer_count` / `order_count` (integer) | [Optional] | Engagement vs. profit correlation. Only if a platform import can populate it reliably — manual entry is low-value. |
| `host_user_id` (uuid)                    | [Optional] | Multi-host attribution; irrelevant while the business is single-operator.                                          |

### Future questions supported

- Which platform performs best / is most profitable (after fees)?
- Which show generates the most profit? Highest margin?
- What is average payout per show? Average profit per hour?
- Which days/times perform best?

## 2. Settlement

> Backed by `owed_line_items` (`obligation_kind = 'SHOW_LINKED'`), with optional
> line-level detail in `settlement_lines`.

### Purpose

The amount a wholesaler is owed for their participation in a show. Settlements
are the bridge between **Show revenue** and **Wholesaler balances**, and the
basis for the current profit model (`Profit = Payout − Settlements`).

| -------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `settled_at` (timestamptz) | [Recommended] | When the settlement was agreed/locked (distinct from `created_at`). Supports "time from show close to settlement" operational metrics. |

### Optional future fields

| Field                                   | Tag        | Why / Question supported                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `item_category` (on `settlement_lines`) | [Optional] | Category-level revenue attribution; only after a shared category vocabulary exists (see §6).                                                                                    |
| `cost_basis_amount`                     | [Optional] | True per-settlement margin instead of show-level margin. High value but requires inventory-to-settlement linkage that does not exist today — defer until inventory is itemized. |

### Future questions supported

- Which wholesalers generate the most revenue / largest obligations?
- What share of show payout is consumed by settlements (margin)?
- (With categories) which product categories drive settlement value?

## 3. Payment

### Purpose

Money paid **to a wholesaler** against their outstanding settlements. Drives
balance reduction and wholesaler payment-behavior analytics.

## 4. Wholesaler Account

> Backed by `accounts` (`type = 'WHOLESALER'`); legacy `wholesalers` retained and
> mapped via `accounts.legacy_wholesaler_id`.

### Purpose

The party FefeAve owes money to. Anchor for balances, payments, and
wholesaler-performance questions. Per the vision, Accounts are the **setup layer**
of the Financials workspace.

## 5. Owner Account

> Backed by `accounts` (`type = 'OWNER'`, single row) and
> `owner_self_pay_transactions`.

### Purpose

Represents the business owner (Felicia) in the ledger. Tracks **self-pay / owner
draw** activity, distinct from wholesaler balances. Foundation for the future
**owner-draw** planning feature.

### Core fields — [Existing]

Account row: same `accounts` shape as §4, constrained to one `OWNER`.

| `source_reserve` (enum: `OPERATING \| REINVESTMENT \| NONE`) | [Recommended, when reserves exist] | Tie a draw to the planning bucket it was funded from; answers "Was this draw within safe limits?" Only meaningful once §9 exists. |

### Future questions supported

- How much has the owner drawn vs. reinvested over time?
- How much can safely be paid as owner draw (with the planning model)?

> **Note (gap):** "Owner Draw" as a _planning surface_ is future, but the
> `OWNER_DRAW` transaction type **already exists**. Future work is mostly
> aggregation + planning UI, not schema redesign.

## 6. Inventory Purchase

### Purpose

Cash spent acquiring inventory. Historically a minimal ledger; the **largest
data gap** relative to the vision's Inventory Performance questions. Enrichment
of this entity is now **in progress** (see implementation note below).

> **Implementation note (2026-05-28, branch `feat/inventory-enrichment-foundation`):**
> The near-term inventory enrichment fields **`supplier`**, **`category`**, and
> **`purchase_type`** have begun implementation as nullable, backward-compatible
> columns on `inventory_purchases`. `category` and `purchase_type` are stored as
> **text** (not DB enums) but constrained to fixed values in the application
> layer (`backend/src/constants/inventory.ts` /
> `frontend/src/lib/constants/inventory.ts`); `supplier` is free text. No
> analytics, ROI, supplier table, or inventory↔show linkage were added — only
> data capture, per this document's "collect data before building analytics"
> guideline.

## 7. Owner Draw _(future)_

### Purpose

A deliberate withdrawal of profit by the owner, framed by the planning model
(`Recommended Owner Draw = Available Cash − Reinvestment Reserve`).

### Status

**Partially exists.** `owner_self_pay_transactions.transaction_type` already
includes `OWNER_DRAW`. The future need is a **planning view** that compares draws
against safe limits — not a new core table.

### Recommended future fields (on the existing transaction)

### Future questions supported

- How much can I safely pay myself this period?
- How much have I drawn YTD vs. reinvested?

## 8. Tax Reserve _(future)_

### Purpose

Money set aside from operating profit for taxes
(`Available Cash = Operating Profit − Tax Reserve`). **No backing table exists
today — this is a true gap.**

### Recommended future shape — [Recommended, deferred]

A `tax_reserves` (or generalized `reserves`) ledger of allocations:

### Future questions supported

- How much should be reserved for taxes this period?
- How much is currently held in reserve?

## 9. Reinvestment Reserve _(future)_

### Purpose

Money earmarked for buying more inventory / growing the business
(`Recommended Owner Draw = Available Cash − Reinvestment Reserve`). **No backing
table today — a true gap.**

### Recommended future shape — [Recommended, deferred]

Mirror the Tax Reserve shape (ideally **one shared `reserves` table** with a
`reserve_type` discriminator: `TAX | REINVESTMENT`):

| Field                                                                              | Tag           | Why / Question supported                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reserve_type` (enum `TAX \| REINVESTMENT`)                                        | [Recommended] | Unify reserves; avoids two near-identical tables                                 |
| `period_start` / `period_end`, `amount`, `basis_profit_amount`, `note`, provenance | [Recommended] | Same rationale as §8                                                             |
| `consumed_amount` (numeric)                                                        | [Optional]    | Track reinvestment actually spent (e.g. linked to inventory purchases) vs. held. |

### Future questions supported

- How much should be reinvested?
- How much reinvestment budget remains unspent?

## 10. Business Expense _(future)_

### Purpose

General operating costs **not** owed to a wholesaler and **not** inventory —
e.g. shipping supplies, software, subscriptions, fees, rent. Needed for the
vision's **Operating Profit** model:

```
Operating Profit = Revenue − Settlements − Inventory − Platform Fees − Business Expenses
```

### Status / current proxy

Today, `owed_line_items` with `obligation_kind = 'VENDOR_EXPENSE'` captures
**vendor-specific** obligations, but that is not the same as general overhead.
General business expenses have **no clean home** — a gap.

### Recommended future shape — [Recommended, deferred]

A dedicated `business_expenses` table (kept separate from settlements so balance
math stays clean):

| Field                                                    | Tag           | Why / Question supported   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `id`                                                     | [Recommended] | Identity                   |
| `expense_date` (date)                                    | [Recommended] | Period grouping            |
| `amount` (numeric)                                       | [Recommended] | Cost                       |
| `category` (enum: Shipping, Software, Fees, Rent, Other) | [Recommended] | "Where does overhead go?"  |
| `vendor` (text)                                          | [Optional]    | Who was paid               |
| `note` (text)                                            | [Optional]    | Memo                       |
| `payment_method` (enum, reuse `payment_method`)          | [Optional]    | Cash-flow / reconciliation |
| timestamps, `created_by`, soft delete                    | [Recommended] | Provenance / audit         |

### Future questions supported

- What is true operating profit (after all costs)?
- Which overhead categories are growing?

# Data Collection Guidelines

These rules govern whether a field should be added. They restate and operationalize
the vision document's data-collection philosophy.

1. **Collect data before building analytics.** Capture the raw fact now; build the
   report later. A field added today gives a year of history by the time a report
   ships.
2. **Every field should support a future business question.** If you cannot name
   the question, do not add the field. (Use the per-field "Question supported"
   column in this doc as the bar.)
3. **Avoid collecting data with no foreseeable use.** Speculative fields add
   schema weight, UI clutter, and migration risk for no payoff.
4. **Historical data is more valuable than perfect analytics.** Prefer storing
   raw, durable facts (e.g. `started_at`/`ended_at`) over derived values
   (`duration`) that lock in one interpretation.

### Supporting principles

- **Store raw, derive on read.** Day-of-week, duration, margins, and balances
  should be computed from stored primitives, not persisted.
- **Free-text first, enum/FK later.** For emerging dimensions (supplier), start
  with free-text, observe real values, then normalize once they stabilize.
- **Keep planning ledgers separate from accounting truth.** Reserves and draws
  are _decisions_, recorded as their own rows; they must never distort balance or
  settlement math.
- **One discriminated table beats many near-identical ones** (e.g. a single
  `reserves` table with `reserve_type`).

# Suggested Near-Term Fields

Low-risk, high-value fields worth capturing **soon** because they unlock vision
questions with minimal schema or UX cost. None require analytics to ship first —
they just start accumulating history.

| Field                     | Entity                   | Why valuable                                                                                            | Risk of adding                                                                                                                                      | Now or later?                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `supplier`                | Inventory Purchase       | Unlocks "best suppliers / highest ROI" (top vision Inventory question). Currently impossible to answer. | **Low.** Nullable free-text column; no balance impact; backfill optional.                                                                           | **Now** (as free-text).                                                  |
| `category`                | Inventory Purchase       | Unlocks "which categories ROI best" + monthly mix.                                                      | **Low.** Nullable enum; small UI dropdown. Risk is only choosing the enum values — keep an `Other`.                                                 | **Now.**                                                                 |
| `purchase_type`           | Inventory Purchase       | Unlocks "which purchase types perform best" (pallet vs. liquidation, etc.).                             | **Low.** Same as category.                                                                                                                          | **Now.**                                                                 |
| `started_at` / `ended_at` | Show                     | Unlocks **profit-per-hour**, the headline Show metric, and is impossible to reconstruct retroactively.  | **Low–Medium.** Two nullable timestamps; optional manual entry. Risk: operators may skip entry → sparse data. Mitigate by making it quick/optional. | **Now** (optional capture) — historical loss is permanent.               |
| `category`                | Wholesaler Account       | Enables grouped wholesaler performance without per-show tagging.                                        | **Low.** Nullable enum/text on `accounts`.                                                                                                          | **Soon** (after inventory category vocabulary settles, to reuse values). |
| `platform_fee_amount`     | Show (`show_financials`) | Clean after-fee platform comparison instead of inferring from `gross − payout`.                         | **Low.** Nullable numeric; today derivable but lossy.                                                                                               | **Soon.**                                                                |
| `notes`                   | Show                     | Already exists — ensure it's surfaced for qualitative context.                                          | **None** ([Existing]).                                                                                                                              | **Already present.**                                                     |

# Gaps in the Current Model

Concrete gaps discovered while reconciling this design against
`backend/migrations/`:

1. **Inventory is too thin.** _Being addressed_ — `supplier`, `category`, and
   `purchase_type` are now in implementation (branch
   `feat/inventory-enrichment-foundation`). ROI still requires inventory↔revenue
   linkage (not in scope). Was the **biggest gap**.
2. **No general business-expense entity.** Operating Profit in the vision model
   subtracts "Business Expenses," but only _vendor_ expenses exist (as
   `owed_line_items`). Overhead (software, shipping, fees, rent) has no home.
3. **No reserves.** Tax Reserve and Reinvestment Reserve have no backing data,
   so "how much to reserve / reinvest / safely draw" cannot be computed.
4. **Platform fees are implicit.** _Being addressed_ —
   `show_financials.platform_fee_amount` is now implemented (capture only). Fee
   history will accrue going forward; historical rows remain implicit
   (`gross − payout` / `adjustments`).
5. **Show duration is unrecorded.** _Being addressed_ — `shows.started_at` /
   `shows.ended_at` are now implemented and captured optionally on the Log Show
   form. Past shows stay null (not reconstructable), so fill rate going forward
   matters.
6. **`gross_sales_amount` is frequently null.** Revenue-based metrics (vs.
   payout-based) are unreliable until gross capture is more consistent.
7. **Owner Draw vs. Self-Pay are stored but not planned.** The `transaction_type`
   discriminator exists; the planning layer that uses it does not. (This is a
   feature gap, not a schema gap — noted as a positive.)

# Top 3–5 Fields to Begin Collecting Next

> **Status:** all five below are now **implemented** (capture only) on branch
> `feat/inventory-enrichment-foundation` — #1–#3 as inventory enrichment, #4–#5
> as the show-profitability foundation. Kept here for traceability.

Prioritized recommendation. All are low-risk additive columns; each maps directly
to a stated vision question and accrues irrecoverable history if delayed.

1. **`inventory_purchases.supplier`** (free-text) — unblocks supplier ROI; today
   completely unanswerable.
2. **`inventory_purchases.category`** (enum) — unblocks category ROI and monthly
   inventory mix.
3. **`inventory_purchases.purchase_type`** (enum) — unblocks purchase-type
   performance comparisons.
4. **`shows.started_at` / `shows.ended_at`** (timestamps) — unblocks
   profit-per-hour; historical data is permanently lost if not captured now.
5. **`show_financials.platform_fee_amount`** (numeric) — clean after-fee platform
   profitability comparison.

> Recommendation: treat #1–#3 as a single small "inventory enrichment" effort
> (they share one form), and #4–#5 as a "show profitability" effort. Each is a
> handful of nullable columns plus optional UI — no redesign required.

# Risks & Open Questions

- **Enum governance.** `category` / `purchase_type` enums will evolve. Decide
  early: DB enum (migration to change) vs. lookup table vs. free-text +
  normalization. Recommendation: **free-text or lookup table** for fast-moving
  dimensions; DB enums only for truly stable sets.
- **Sparse optional data.** Optional fields (duration, supplier) are only as
  useful as their fill rate. Open question: make them required-ish via UX nudges,
  or accept partial history?
- **Reserves as ledger vs. setting.** Are tax/reinvestment reserves a running
  ledger of allocations, or a single configurable rate applied on read? This doc
  assumes a **ledger** (auditable history); confirm before building §8/§9.
- **Inventory ↔ revenue linkage.** True ROI needs purchases tied to the
  shows/settlements that sold them. That requires a sell-through workflow not yet
  designed. Open question: is purchase-level ROI (spend vs. period revenue) "good
  enough," or is item-level attribution required?
- **Gross sales reliability.** Should `gross_sales_amount` become required (where
  the platform provides it) to make revenue-based metrics trustworthy?
- **Single-owner assumption.** Owner Account and several "host"/draw concepts
  assume one operator. Revisit if the business adds operators.
- **Scope discipline.** Several future entities (reserves, expenses) flirt with
  the vision's non-goals (tax filing, accounting). Keep them as **planning
  inputs**, not bookkeeping — re-check against `financials-vision-v2.md` before
  implementing.
